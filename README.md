# Video Detection Fog Computing
In an increasingly interconnected and data-centric world, the demand for real-time video analytics with low latency and high precision has surged across various sectors. This academic project explores a solution that harnesses the potential of fog computing to streamline video streaming, while concurrently employing computer vision techniques to identify obstacles within the video streams. The system is structured around three pivotal components: the Video Ingestion Node, the Fog Computing Cluster, and the Client Viewer, offering a comprehensive framework for enhancing person detection in a clustered environment.

## Project Overview:

Our academic endeavor centers on the development of a distributed video analytics system with an emphasis on real-time person detection. It entails an intricate synergy of cutting-edge technologies and methodologies, ultimately culminating in a holistic solution for processing video streams in real-time, with an unwavering commitment to precision and efficiency.

### 1. Video Ingestion Node:

The Video Ingestion Node serves as the primary data entry point within our architectural framework. Its paramount role encompasses the aggregation of video streams from diverse sources, such as XR devices, surveillance cameras, drones, and IoT devices. This component meticulously transmits these video feeds to the subsequent layer, the Fog Computing Cluster, ensuring the seamless and reliable ingestion of video data.

### 2. Fog Computing Cluster:

The Fog Computing Cluster represents the computational core of our system, imbued with the capability to execute edge computing operations. This cluster is orchestrated to minimize latency while maximizing processing throughput. Within this cluster, computer vision algorithms are applied, resulting in the real-time identification and tracking of individuals depicted within the video frames. The utilization of fog computing principles empowers our system with unparalleled speed and accuracy in video analytics, thereby fostering rapid and precise person detection.

### 3. Client Viewer:

The Client Viewer materializes as the user-facing interface, facilitating end-users' access to live video streams and associated analytics. It extends beyond mere passive observation, providing real-time updates on person detection outcomes.

## Key Features:

- Low Latency: The system capitalizes on fog computing's decentralized processing to curtail latency, catering to scenarios where immediate responsiveness is paramount.

- Precise Person Detection: Leveraging advanced computer vision algorithms, our system distinguishes and continuously tracks individuals within video frames, culminating in highly accurate outcomes.

- Scalability: The architecture is inherently scalable, with provisions for horizontal scaling by augmenting the Fog Computing Cluster's computational capacity, ensuring it can adeptly accommodate an expanding array of video streams.

## Academic Significance:

This academic project works within the realm of fog computing and video analytics. It explores a usage scenario capable of showing how real-time data processing and fog computing in clustered environments can be applied in everyday life and merged into XR applications.
